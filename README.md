# ChessOpeningLearning

This project is a prototype of an app to learn chess openings with a physical chess game.

Place your chess game next to your smartphone / tablet and arrange the pieces as if to start a normal game.
Each player will tap when it is their turn to play, being forced to play the opening move indicated by the app.

When the opening is over, you should play the game normally. After the game, you can try to play again with a new opening.
